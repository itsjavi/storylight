StoryLite is a modern and lightweight tool for developing and managing design systems and components. It is inspired by
the popular StoryBook UI and built on top of Vite‚ö°Ô∏è, offering a streamlined and user-friendly experience.

With StoryLite, individuals and teams can quickly create, test, and iterate on their UI components in isolation to
ensure consistency across the application.

Designed for small projects that don't require all the features and complexity of a full-blown StoryBook setup,
StoryLite provides a familiar UI that is easy to use and customize to each team's unique needs.

## Features

- Lightweight and customizable, with a minimal set of dependencies.
- Small project that can be used either as a template or as a standalone server.
- Addons system with the basics (dark mode, viewport size, grid, outline, fullscreen, etc.).
- Customizable via `storylite.config.js` file (or `.ts`).
- Supports `.stories.jsx` and `.stories.tsx` stories.

## Limitations

- Currently, there is no support for things such as "auto docs", "code snippets", "knobs", "controls", "actions"
  or "events".
- It has only been tested with React components, but it should work with any framework that Vite supports. Support
  and/or fixes for Vue, Svelte, Solid, and others is welcome via PRs.
- No support for MDX files, to keep the project simple, but adding support via PRs is welcome as long as it doesn't
  add too much complexity.
- Changes to the config file will require a full server restart at the moment.
